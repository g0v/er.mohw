# Requirements
There are no dependencies, Grafana is a client side application that runs in your browser. It only needs a time series store where it can fetch metrics. If you use InfluxDB Grafana can use it to store dashboards. If you use Graphite or OpenTSDB you can use Elasticsearch to store dashboards or just use json files stored on disk.
